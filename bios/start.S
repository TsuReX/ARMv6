#include "ports.S"

/* .include "ports.S"
 * This construction shouldn't be used.
 * ports.S is assebmler language source file which contains C preprocessor constructions,
 * the constructions are processed by C-preprocessor and pure assembler language source code file is generated,
 * but .include directive says to assembler to get NOT preprocessed file ports.S with C-preprocessor 
 * constructions what causes assembling error.
 * .include directive should be used for pure assebly language files only!
